Life-Time of Registered service :

Singleton : Its object will be created once the application runs. 
Transient : Its object will be created with every request.
Scoped    : Its object will be created for every diff scope.

DI : We can achieve DI by these 3 ways: 
1. Constructor Injection 2. Method Injection  3. Property Injection

Steps : 

1. Firstly we have to create 2 folders : Interface and Service
2. Then We'll add an Interface in the interface folder.
3. Then we'll create a class for implemention of interface in Service folder.
4. Then we'll inherit the interface in the class and implement the methods.

5. We have to register our service within ConfigureService method in Startup class.
Syntax :  services.AddSingleton<IStudent, Student>();

6. We have to create a readonly property in our class/controller where we want to use this interface.
	Syntax : private readonly IStudent student;

7. Now we'll inject our service through constructor .
	Syntax : 
		public StudentController(IStudent _student)
        {
            student = _student;
        }
